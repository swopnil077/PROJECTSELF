¢ Many electrical engineering devices such as inductors, transformers, rotating
machines etc. are based on the utilization of magnetic properties of materials.

¢ When a magnetic dipole is placed in a magnetic field, it experiences a torque that
tries to rotate the magnetic moment to align its axis with the magnetic field.

Magnetization Vector (M)

The magnetic field inside the solenoid with free space inside is By given by
Bo = Upnl

where n is number of turns per unit length,

* If a cylindrical material is placed inside the solenoid, the magnetic field will be changed from Bo
to B.

* Each atom of the material responds to the applied field and develops a net magnetic moment
[Lm along the applied field.

* The medium gets magnetized, Magnetization vector M describes the extent of magnetization of
the medium.

¢ Magnetization vector M is defined as magnetic dipole moment per unit volume.
M= 1 ON _ ; where Ngtomic= NuMber of atoms per unit volume,

Magnetizing Field, Magnetic Field Intensity

¢ The field inside the magnetized material is the sum of the applied field H and a contribution from
the magnetization M at the material.
¢ Magnetizing field H is the cause and magnetic field B is its effect.

¢ H solely depends upon external conduction currents only whereas the magnetic field B depends
on the magnetization capability of the material.

Magnetic Permeability and Susceptibility

The magnetic permeability of the medium at any point is defined as the magnetic field per unit
magnetizing field

h= 7H represents to what extent a medium is permeable by a magnetic field.

Relative permeability of the medium is defined as the fractional increase in the magnetic field with
respect to the magnetic field in free space when a material medium is introduced.

The magnetization M produced in the material depends on the net magnetic field B.
Magnetization M is related to magnetizing field H as M = ¥,,H ; xm is magnetic susceptibility
Now, B = By + UpM

B = [MoH (due to vacuum) + fy9M (due to material)

B= MoH + HoXmH This expression relates the relative permeability

B= (1+ X¥m)MoH with magnetic susceptibility of the material.
B = U,UoH; where pw, = (1 + Xm)

6/20/2023 MK/ EEM 7


Ferromagnetism

Ferromagnetic materials can possess large permanent magnetization even in the absence of
an applied field.

The magnetic susceptibility is positive and very large and depends on the applied field
intensity.

The relationship between magnetization M and [oH is highly non — linear.
At sufficiently high fields, magnetization saturates.

The ferromagnetic crystal has magnetic moments of all crystal aligned in an orderly manner so
as to give rise to the net magnetization vector M.

Ferromagnetism occurs below a _ critical
temperature T.. called Curie temperature.

At temperature above this, ferromagnetism is
lost.

6/20/2023 MK/EEM Fig. 5.5 Magnetized region of Ferromagnetic material


Anti-ferromagnetism

¢ Antiferromagnetism materials have small positive susceptibility.
¢ In the absence of external field, there is not net magnetization of the material.

¢ They possess magnetic ordering in which the magnetic moments on alternating atoms in

the crystals align in opposite directions — due to quantum mechanical exchange
interaction.

¢ Occurs below a critical temperature called Néel temperature. Above this they are
paramagnetic.

¢ These substances are freely magnetized when subjected to a
strong magnetic field.

¢ Example: MnO, FeO, CoO, NiO, FeClzMn0Q,, Cr, Mn, MnS etc

Ferrimagnetism

Ferrimagnetic materials exhibit magnetic behavior similar to ferromagnetism below
a critical temperature called Curie temperature.

As shown in the figure, all atoms A have their spins aligned in one direction and all
atoms B have their spins aligned in opposite direction.

Magnetic moment of atom A is greater than that of atom B because of which there
will be net magnetization in the crystal even in the absence of external applied field.

These materials are non- conducting, so they do not [5 }#696—++o Coen |
suffer from eddy current losses. |
This is the reason for these materials being used in high Ore-O O-meO
frequency electronic applications.

These materials are generally known as ferrites and
represented by XFe304_ where X=
Mg, Cu, Mn, Ni, Zn, Cd etc.

Paramagnetism

Paramagnetic materials have small positive magnetic susceptibility.

In the absence of external magnetic field, molecular moments (atomic moments) are randomly
oriented due to random collision of molecules.

So, the average dipole moment and the net magnetization both are zero.

When an external field is applied, ,,, does not equal zero and depends upon the applied field
[HoH and hence the magnetization is also non — zero and is equal to 7,,,H.

Magnetization increase with f4gH but decreases with increase in temperature.

At higher temperature, the molecular collisions destroy the alignment of molecular magnetic
moments with applied field i.e. Curie law is obeyed.

Diamagnetism

Materials with negative magnetic susceptibility are termed as diamagnetic substances.
Relative permeability is slightly less than unity.

When placed in magnetic field, the magnetization vector M is in opposite direction to the
applied field > causing magnetic field within the material to be less than the applied field.

Negative susceptibility > these substances trying to expel the applied field from within the
material.

Covalent crystals and many ionic crystals are diamagnetic because the constituent atoms
have no unfilled sub-shell.

Superconductors are perfect diamagnet with y,, = —1 and totally expel the applied field.

Other examples are Bi, Sb, Au, Cu, Hg, water, air, alkali halides, organic materials, many
polymers, covalent solids like Si, Ge, diamond etc.

The average value of magnetic susceptibility of diamagnetic materials is in the range of
—10~°

Domain Structure / Domain Theory of Ferromagnetism

A magnetic domain is a region of the crystal in which all the spin magnetic moments are
aligned to produce a magnet in one direction only.

Figure alongside shows a single crystal of iron that has a permanent magnetization.

There is a potential energy stored in a magnetic field called magnetostatic energy which can be
reduced in the external field by dividing the crystal into two domains where the
magnetizations are in opposite directions.

\ \ 90° domain wall
Thus, there is a boundary between the N

Domain Structure / Domain Theory of Ferromagnetism

The magnetostatic energy can be further reduced by eliminating these external field lines by
closing the ends with sideway domains (Closure domain) with magnetization at 90°.

Forming domains reduces magnetostatic energy but potential energy in the walls increases
due to addition of walls.

When we apply an external magnetic field to the crystal
with domains as in the figure, the magnetization of
crystal along the field occurs, in principle, by the growth
of domains with magnetization along the field 'H’.

i.e. the wall between domain A and domain B migrates
towards right enlarging domain A and shrinking domain
B which is caused by spins in the wall, and also spins in

region B adjacent to the wall. Figure (e) Figure (f)

Losses in magnetic materials

¢ When magnetic materials are subjected to changing magnetic field (flux), two types of
losses occur which are:

¢ Eddy current loss
¢ Hysteresis loss

¢ Eddy Current Loss:

Eddy currents are loops of electric currents induced within materials by a changing magnetic field
because of Faraday’s laws of induction.

Eddy current flow in closed path perpendicular to the applied magnetic field.

Eddy current creates its own magnetic field that oppose the magnetic field that created it, following
Lenz’ Law.

¢ Eddy currents generate resistive losses that transform some form of energy to heat which reduces
efficiency of iron - core of transformers and electric motors and other devices that use changing
magnetic field.

¢ Eddy currents are minimized in these devices by selecting magnetic core materials that have low
electrical conductivity (e.g. Ferrites) or by using thin sheet of core forming laminations.


Hysteresis Loop and loss

The complete M versus H curve obtained by changing magnetizing field (H) from positive x to negative x
for corresponding values of magnetization is a closed loop called as hysteresis loop.

When an external magnetic field 'H' is applied to an unmagnetized iron sample,
* at start there is very small net magnetization

* as the value of ‘H’ is increased, the domain motion extend to larger shapes encountering various obstacles such as

crystal imperfections, impurities and so on.
Sudden changes in magnetization induce

eddy currents (circulating current) that 4 £2 Ms }-------

As we go on increasing the external
magnetic field, eventually a_ single ,.
domain is created and further increase
in field, causes M to align in the
direction of H and then the sample -x
reaches saturation magnetization M,,; “A. o

Hysteresis Loop and loss

Now, if the magnetizing force is reduced then magnetization of iron sample decreases
Even when the magnetizing force is reduced to zero, induced magnetization does not reduced to zero

Some residual remains called as residual magnetization (M,.), also called as retentivity. This is useful in a
magnetic memory device.

If magnetizing field is applied
in the reverse direction,
magnetization of the sample
decreases and at a certain
value, magnetization 'M'
becomes zero.

The magnetizing field
required to totally
demagnetize the sample is
called coercive field H,, also
called as coercivity. _B

Hysteresis Loop and loss

If the demagnetization is further increased in reverse direction, the process from point e will be similar
to that when magnetizing the sample in reverse direction.

Point g represents saturation magnetization —M,,,;in reverse direction.

Decreasing the magnetizing field
from —H, q; to zero again leaves
residual magnetization.

To eliminate this we need to apply
magnetizing field in reverse aH
direction.

The energy dissipated during
magnetization & demagnetization
process is given by the area of
hysteresis loop.

Soft Magnetic material

That magnetic material which can be easily magnetized and demagnetized is called soft
magnetic material.
These materials have
* very low value of coercivity,
* very large saturation magnetization (M,,;)
* small hysteresis area.
* Ideally zero coercivity,
* zero retentivity
* very large saturation magnetization.

Their B-H curve has small area, so the power loss per unit cycle is small.

Thus, suitable for applications where repeated cycles of magnetization and demagnetization
are involved.

Examples: electric motors, transformers, inductor having varying field, electromagnetic relay.

6/20/2023 MK/ EEM 20


Hard Magnetic materials

That magnetic material which is difficult to magnetized and demagnetized is called hard
magnetic material.
These materials have
° very large coercivity,
* very large saturation magnetization (M,,;)
° large hysteresis area.

The coercive field for hard magnetic materials is millions
of times greater than those for soft magnetic materials.

Their B-H curve is broad and almost rectangular in shape,
so the power loss per unit cycle is high.

They are useful for making permanent magnets and in
magnetic storage of digital data.

6/20/2023 MK/ EEM 21


Fe — Si alloys, Ni —Fe alloys

Pure iron (Fe) despite being soft magnetic material is not normally used as magnetic material because its
conductivity allows large eddy currents to be induced under varying fields.

By adding (2 — 4%) of Silicon to Iron, Silicon Steel is obtained which is still soft magnetic material with
increased resistivity but reduced eddy current loss.

Mostly used in manufacture of transformers and other electrical machineries for alternating current
applications.

Similarly, Nickel — Iron alloys with composition around 77% Ni and 23% Fe constitute a soft magnetic
material with low coercivity, low hysteresis loss and high initial and maximum relative permeabilities.

* High initial relative permeability useful in low magnetic field applications that are typically found in high
frequency works in electronics like audio and wide band transformers. More applications on: sensitive relays,
current transformers, magnetic recording heads, magnetic shielding etc.

Alloying Iron with Nickel increases resistivity and hence reduces the eddy current losses in the machinery.
The domain wall motions are easy in Nickel composition resulting smaller hysteresis losses in the material.

There are number of commercial Ni — Fe alloys whose application depends on exact composition ( which
may also have a few percentages of Mo, Cr, Cu, etc) and method of preparation (e.g. mechanical rolling).

Ferrites for high frequency transformers Co)

° Ferrites are ferromagnetic materials which are typically oxides of mixed transition metals, one of which is iron.

* Ferrites are ferromagnetic materials, normally insulators, so do not suffer from eddy current losses (very high
resistance allows only very small current and hence very small or no losses) > thus suitable for high frequency
applications

* Ferrites can have high initial permeabilities and low losses, but they do not possess large saturation
magnetization like that in ferromagnets.

¢ There are many types of ferrites available depending on the application, tolerable losses and required upper
frequency of operation.
¢ Manganese Zinc Ferrites have high initial relative permeability of 2000 but are only useful up to 1 MHz.

° Nickel Zinc Ferrites have lower initial relative permeability of 200 but they can be used up to a frequency of
200 MHz.

* Garnets are ferrimagnetic materials, used at highest frequencies covering the microwave range (1 — 300
GHz). Yttrium Iron Garnet YIG (Y3 Fe;0;2)
* one of the simplest garnets with very low hysteresis loss at microwave frequencies.
* Have excellent dielectric properties with high resistivities and consequently low losses.
* Main disadvantage of garnets is the low saturation magnetization and low Curie temperature.

¢ The initial relative permeability in the high frequency region decreases with increase in frequency.

6/20/2023 MK/ EEM 23


Square Loop Magnetic Materials

Materials having very high coercivities are termed as square loop magnetic materials because
of the B-H loop imitating the square shape.

To store any information in the form of digitalized data, these materials are most suited.

Uses different patterns of magnetization in a magnetizable material to store data and is a
form of non —-volatile memory

The magnetic surface is conceptually divided into many small sub-mm sized magnetic
regions, referred as magnetic domains. Information is stored on these domains.

Have high (BH)max values, used in stepper motors, servomotors, gyroscope

The only drawback of these materials are lower Curie temperature compared to other
magnetic materials.
